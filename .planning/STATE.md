# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-09-19)

**Core value:** One command installs a working LibreChat (API + MongoDB + Meilisearch) natively on YunoHost with a valid nginx proxy, a functioning systemd service, and reliable backup/restore.
**Current focus:** Phase 4 — Lint Baseline (v1.1 CI Validation)

## Current Position

Milestone: v1.1 CI Validation (phases 4-7)
Phase: 4 of 7 (Lint Baseline)
Plan: 0 of ? in current phase (not yet planned)
Status: Ready to plan
Last activity: 2026-09-19 — Roadmap created for v1.1

Progress: [░░░░░░░░░░] 0%

## Performance Metrics

**Velocity:**

| Phase | Plans | Total | Avg/Plan |
|-------|-------|-------|----------|
| v1.0 (1-3) | 7 | 7 | - |

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table. Recent for v1.1:

- [Research]: GH Actions = lint-only; full package_check on hosted runners is an anti-feature (Incus/btrfs requirements + OOM). Official YNH CI covers the full suite after catalog submission.
- [Research]: Phase order — linter first (zero infra), then tests.toml + local PC env, then fix-findings iteration, GH workflow last so it starts green.
- [Research]: `tests.toml` must supply `args.admin_email`; never use `exclude` to fake green CI.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- [Phase 5]: Local Incus host availability — research flags WSL2 as NOT viable for Incus; confirm the user's Linux VM/VPS setup during Phase 5 planning (milestone's biggest logistical dependency).
- [Phase 6]: package_check is stricter than the live v1.0 install (subpath, private, reinstall, upgrade-from-commit paths never exercised) — expect unknown-scope findings.
